## **Introduction**

This is the 6th of 10 weekly logs documenting my progress through GEOG 777. The class consists of two large projects. This log marks the beginning of my progress through Project #2.

### Project #2

The second project is to "*create a mobile-friendly map application for a park using user-centered design*". The map must utilize a back-end database and contain several map-layers of information, one of which user-submitted. I will be producing a park map for my favorite local nature spot, **Huntley Meadows Park** located in Fairfax County, Virginia.

## **1) Skills & Strategies**

Solving this challenge will require a diverse set of skills including but not limited to:

- Full-stack web development
- Cartographic UX/UI design
- Relational database design

Initial list of technologies I plan on using (tech stack):

| Technology | Description                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Leaflet    | Interactive mapping interface  |
| Angular    | Front-end JavaScript framework |
| NPM        | Front-end package manager      |
| PostgreSQL | Database system                |
| Heroku     | Platform / host                |
| VS Code    | IDE / code editor              |
| QGIS       | Desktop GIS software           |

## **2) Processes & Steps**

Initial Plan:

1. **Initialize GIT Repo** (Initially for notes & brainstorming; later for code source control)
2. **Architect Initial Tech Stack** (Determine which technologies will work together to solve the problem)
3. **Research Existing Park Map Applications** (Imitation is the finest form of flattery)
4. **Perform Outreach** (There is a 501(c)(3) Nonprofit organization called Friends of Huntley Meadows who may be interested in this project)
5. **Write User Stories Based On Research** (User Stories will drive app development and ensure it is always focused on purpose)
6. **Create Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** (For the database)
7. **Begin Construction of Front-End** (Create the angular elements, initial CSS, functionality, etc.)
8. **Build & Populate Database** (Based on the ERD)
9. **Fine-Tune** (Fiddle with the application until it meets my expectations)

This week I accomplished writing this initial plan, as well as completing steps **#1** and **#2**.

## **3) Challenges & Contingencies**

I anticipate my biggest challenges will be user authentication and user input since these are the areas I currently have the least experience in. My worst-case contingency will be simply allowing open access to user submissions, but I will try my best to prevent this so that this app might actually be used long-term.

## **4) What's Next**

My next steps are **#3** researching existing park map applications for inspiration and **#4** reaching out to the Friends of Huntley Meadows Nonprofit. I plan to 1) inform them about my project, 2) ask their opinion about important things to display in the Park Map, and 3) ask if they would be interested in posting a link to my app on their website once it's finished.
