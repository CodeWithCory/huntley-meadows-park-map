## **1) Skills & Strategies**

The skills used this week were primarily related to front-end developer operations (Dev Ops) and back-end relational database design. In order to avoid complications, I've decided not to perform outreach to the Friends of Huntley Meadows right now, especially with the Coronavirus threat looming.

Specifically, this week I:

1. Initialized the Angular front-end codebase
2. Initialized the Node Express server to conduct database calls and serve the front-end
3. Designed the database

Here is the database schema I've designed:


**users**

| Key | Attribute Name     | Data Type   | Length | Description                  |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
|     | id                 | serial      | n/a    | Serial ID number             |
| PK  | username           | varchar     | 15     | Unique ID for a user         |
|     | password_hash      | varchar     | ?      | Unique ID for a user         |
|     | email              | varchar     | 320    | Email address                |
|     | created_time_stamp | timestamptz | n/a    | Date-time of record creation |
| FK  | permission_level   | varchar     | 15     | User permission level        |

**local_favorites**

| Key | Attribute Name     | Data Type   | Length | Description                   |
| --- | ------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| PK  | id                 | serial      | n/a    | Serial ID number              |
| FK  | submitter_un       | varchar     | 15     | Unique ID for a user          |
|     | name               | varchar     | 70     | Short feature name            |
|     | category           | varchar     | 15     | Category of the feature       |
|     | description        | varchar     | 280    | Description of the feature    |
|     | image_url          | text        | n/a    | Description of the feature    |
|     | latitude           | number      |        |                               |
|     | longitude          | number      |        |                               |
|     | approved           | boolean     | n/a    | If a reviewer has approved it |
|     | views              | number      | ?      | Number of "read more" views   |
|     | created_time_stamp | timestamptz | n/a    | Date-time of record creation  |

**permissions** (Lookup Table)

| Key | Attribute Name | Data Type | Length | Description           |
| --- | -------------- | --------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| PK  | permission     | varchar   | 15     | User permission level |


## **2) Processes & Steps**

In order to complete my goals this week I used several resources for guidance and reference. For the database design I looked back at course material from GEOG 574: Geospatial Database Design. For the initialization of the server and front-end code I followed online guidance for the relatively common Node Express & Angular stack. 

## **3) Challenges & Contingencies**

My biggest challenge will be creating a secure login system that allows permission levels to have meaningful impact. I want users to have to be authenticated in order to be able to add data to my database of Local Favorites. My contingency will be to utilize a 3rd-party login service to assist in authentication, such "Sign in with" Google and Apple.

## **4) What's Next**

Next I will:

- Create a Heroku project to initialize a PostgreSQL database
- Construct first-draft of the front-end
- Create static data layers & add them to the map
