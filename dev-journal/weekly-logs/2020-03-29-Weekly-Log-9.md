## **1) Skills & Strategies**

The skills I used this week were heavy in cartographic design. My main focus was designing an attractive, powerful basemap to serve as the backbone of the application. My basemap consists of three TileLayers:

| Basemap                        | Zoom Levels | Characteristics                |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1. MapBox Basic Edited Overlay | 14-18       | Labels, paths, landmarks       |
| 2. Stamen Watercolor           | 14-16       | Beautiful watercolor-style art |
| 3. Esri Imagery                | 17-18       | Detailed park imagery          |

These three layers work together to support the entire app, showing more information as the user zooms in:

| Zoom Level | Basemap Information                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| 14         | Overview of the park Stamen Watercolor's park outline  |
| 15         | Paths appear throughout the park map                   |
| 16         | A new watercolor texture appears with more crisp paths |
| 17         | Imagery and path labels appear                         |
| 18         | Imagery is easier to see                               |

## **2) Processes & Steps**

The first step to designing the basemap was finding contenders. I immediately though of Stamen Watercolor because it's so beautiful. I had the idea to enrich the watercolor basemap by making MapBox's polygon-fills transparent to create an overlay. The stamen watercolor maps stop after Zoom Level 16 so I switch the underlying baseman to Imagery for those who want to see more detail on the

## **3) Challenges & Contingencies**

A big challenge right now is scope. I've decided to fall back on simpler requirements by omitting user authentication and just focusing on the cartography and user experience.

## **4) What's Next**

Next I will:

- Construct the other static layers for the map (facilities/points-of-interest, recommended routes)
- Build user-submission for the Local Favorites layer
- Build simple UI focused on layer options and getting started.
